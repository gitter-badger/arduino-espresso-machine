* Arduino maintains water level in the boiler. Probing water level is throttled to one second to slow down electrolysis â€“ the continuity circuit uses digital IO pin as output and an analog pin as input. Boiler doesn't refill if dispensing is in progress.
* Three relays control the pump, boiler, boiler refill solenoid and E61 solenoid.
* Pushbutton starts and stops dispensing by turning on the pump and E61 solenoid.
* Low tank water level is indicated by flashing LEDs.
* Boiler is controlled by a pressurestat and thermo switch on a separate AC circuit. It is turned off when the boiler water level is low.
* Built for ECM Veneziano A1 (semi-auto HX machine with volumetric control).

## TODO

- post hydraulic schematic
- get flowmeter working for volumetric control
